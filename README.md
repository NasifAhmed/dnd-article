- The code uses TypeScript and React. If you don't understand typescript or TSX syntax you can just ignore the type stuff they are not needed in this small example. Its just like regular JSX.

## Steps to run on your local machine :
* Clone the repo to see it in action with ```bash git clone https://github.com/NasifAhmed/dnd-article/```
* `cd` into the folder. Run ```bash npm install```
* After installation just run ```bash npm run dev``` . Now it will run on your localhost.

Thanks. Stars will be appericiated :)
